# pfm_peru

## Description
This project as the name describes, is a personal finance manager for peruvians, it started as a idea
to store all my vouchers on a centrilized software, in the end of the year there are taxes to be paid
therefore an algorithm to autocalculate is expected to be implemented by the end of the next fiscal 
year. 
This project is also intended to be read or reviewed by scouts or talent seekers whom would like
to review my python portfolio, so if you are feel free to contact me through linkedin or email.
